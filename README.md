# linuxCollect
Collect Systeminformation over ssh.

Goal was to collect systeminfo from multiple hosts over ssh and write the output in a html-file for each host.
But could also take a list of any commands that will be executed on the the remote hosts.
The actual command list is just for testing purposes.

This is my first contact with python, it´s mostly a self learning project.
If anyone has some tipps i would be thankful.
